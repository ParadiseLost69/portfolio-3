# Portfolio

## Technologies Used

- React
- CSS
- Framer-motion
- React Suite

My portfolio created using React. It took me a little while to decide whether I wanted to use Next.js or not so that I could potentially benefit from SSR or SSG but I ultimately decided against it as there were some compatibility issues with React Suite.

This should serve as a "best-of" page. An overview of different projects that I have built using different skills that I have gained as a self-taught developer.
